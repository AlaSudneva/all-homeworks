**TASK 3:**
Sometimes, in the tester's work, it's necessary to redirect requests from one environment to another.  
For instance, direct testing on the production environment may not be allowed, and one must interact with a testing environment.  
Let's assume that http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/ represents the production version, and http://demowebshop.tricentis.com/qa  
is the QA environment (ignore the fact that this page does not exist). Your task is to redirect the request from Prod to QA."
