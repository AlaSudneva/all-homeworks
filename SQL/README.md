As part of the homework, I have completed the following SQL queries.  

The content of the assignment:  

**TASK 1**
1. Retrieve the first name, last name, and patronus of all characters with a known patronus.  

2. Retrieve the last names of characters whose last letter in the surname is 'e'.  

3. Calculate the total age of all characters and display it.  

4. Display the name, last name, and age of characters in descending order of their age.  

5. Display the name and age of characters whose age is between 50 and 100.  

6. Display the ages of characters, ensuring that no two characters have the same age.  

7. Display all information about characters with the faculty Gryffindor and an age greater than 30.  

8. Display the names of the first three faculties from the table without repetition.  

9. Display the names of characters whose names start with 'H' and consist of 5 letters, or whose names start with 'L'.  

10. Calculate the average age of all characters.  

11. Delete the character with ID = 11.  

12. Display the last names of characters that contain the letter 'a'.  

13. Use an alias to temporarily replace the column name 'fname' with 'Half-Blood Prince' for the real Half-Blood Prince.  

14. Display the IDs and names of all patronuses in alphabetical order, considering only those that exist or are known.  

15. Use the IN operator to display the names and last names of characters with the last name Crabbe, Granger, or Diggory.  

16. Display the minimum age of a character.  

17. Use the UNION operator to select names from the 'characters' table and book titles from the 'library' table.  

18. Use the HAVING operator to count the number of characters in each faculty, only keeping faculties with more than 1 student.  

19. Use the CASE operator to describe the logic and display the name, last name, and a message based on the character's faculty.  

20. Use a regular expression to find surnames that do not start with the letters H, L, or S and display them.

**TASK 2**  
1. Display the first name, last name of characters, and the title of the book they are associated with.  

2. Display the first name, last name of characters, and the title of the book they are associated with, regardless of whether they have a book or not.  

3. Display the title of the book and the name of the patronus, regardless of whether there is information about the book's owner in the table or not.  

4. Display the first name, last name, age of characters, and the title of the book they are associated with, under the condition that all book owners must be older than 15 years.  

5. Display the name of the character, the title of the book, the issue date, and the completion date, under the condition that the character is younger than 15 years old and their patronus is unknown.  

6. Using a nested query, output the number of books where the end_date is greater than the end_date for Hermione.  

7. Using a nested query, display the names of all patronuses whose owners are older than the age of the character with the patronus 'Unknown'.
